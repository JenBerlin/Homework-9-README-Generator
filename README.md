# Homework-08-README-Generator

##Description

##Description
This application is an commandline application, which allows the user to generate a README file just by using the terminal - if all files are in place. By starting the application the user will get asked several questions and the input represent the README content in the end. The question itself are in such a way structured that they refer to a main README file headline/section. After the completion a README-generated.md gets automatically created and saved on the repositery.
