## <a name="description-id">Description</a>
This README will be now generated by the README-Generator. This application makes it for user easy and convenient to write a README by a predefined layout and README sections. It uses Node.js - the backend Javascript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine.

## <a name="installation-id">Installation</a>
For running the application you will need to install Node.js on your computer. The README file gets generated by using simply terminal commands. 

## <a name="usage-id">Usage</a>
Make sure you have installed npm and Node.js. Is this done you can open your terminal to run the application. You can open the files in your VS Code editor or you copy and paste the file path of the saved index.js file directly in the terminal to get started. The displayed questions need to be answered by adding your input and pressing enter for the next question. With submission of the last input a README.md file gets generated and saved automatically.
